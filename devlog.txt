11/6 - (HaotianG) Database, Registration, Login, Finished Creating/Editing/Deleting New Posts Functionality
- Added functions to database.py for creating, deleting, editing posts
- Modfiied existing pages so that they use the database
- Added session authentication 
  - The client sends his username / password as plaintext to the server
  - Server checks the database to see if they match an existing user
  - If it matches, then the server sets the user's session cookie to the user's user_id in the database
  - The session cookie is used to check if the user is signed in or not
  - If the user is not signed in on a page where he should be, then he is redirected
- Modified registration so displays errors for if the username is already taken
- Every user has their own blog page now

Some more notes:
- row_id is used to determine which blog entries are most recent. We could store a unix time date if we wanted to, instead
- the website will crash if you look up something that doesn't exist, like a non existent user blog post or entry. I will fix this later
- Used "QMark" style in database.py for mysqllite3 commands
